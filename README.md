## Development

### Working with this and other git codebases

Best practices dictate the following workflow when working with git repository
code:

* Create a fork of the codebase to your own personal GitHub account using the
**Fork** button; this makes it much easier to keep track of who is working on
a git repository by simply looking at the fork tree.
* Checkout a 'feature branch' on your personal fork to start working in. Don't
simply work from the same branch that exists on the main fork. This ensures even
further that it's clear who is working on what, and allows for development on
multiple features simultaneously.
* Work locally in that 'feature branch', then add any new files and commit
changes using a descriptive commit message
* Push that commit back to your personal fork of the codebase
* Create a pull request on GitHub requesting the merge of the changed code on
your personal fork/branch into the main codebase.

Automatic messaging features are set up on OCLS GitHub repositories that will
notify discoverygarden of requests to features so they can be reviewed.
